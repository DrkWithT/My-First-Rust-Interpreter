# README

### Brief
My second ever project in Rust. This will become a mini-language called Loxie as a very small derivative of the educational Lox language.

### What Loxie Looks Like

### Design
 - Procedural & functional paradigm
 - Static & strong typing + null safety
 - First-class lambdas vs. declared procedures
 - Built-in functions galore!

### Feature Roadmap
 - Add foreign function stub support. (**WIP 1**)
 - Fix semantic analysis to recognize native funcs. (**WIP 2**)
 - Add simple imports
 - Support strings
 - Support arrays
 - Support lambdas
 - Add more standard I/O native functions!

### Side Roadmap
 - Improve error diagnostics (**WIP 3**)
 - Improve syntax highlighting on Loxie's local VSCode extension
 - Add optimization passes on IR
    - Instruction substitutions
